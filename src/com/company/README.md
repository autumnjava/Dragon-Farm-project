User choses [1-4] players, [5-30] rounds.

Each round player gets 6 choices:
a. Buy dragons
b. Buy food
c. Feed dragons
d. Pair dragons (50-50 chance to succeed)
e. Sell dragons
x. Do nothing. Jump to next player

Player leaves the game if he/she has no dragons and no money.
Each round dragon health decreases by random 10-30 percent.

In the end, selling all dragons and printing out winners.
